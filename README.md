# Employee-Promotion-Prediction

This research paper focuses on Human Resources Analytics based on Data Mining methods to build a predictive model for determining an employee's eligibility for promotion. Promotion within a workplace offers numerous advantages such as increased prestige, respect, and wages/salary, along with greater freedom and agency.

Consequently, employees at various levels in an organization strive to climb the corporate ladder to enjoy these benefits. Organizations attach significant importance to promotion decisions, as the actions of individuals in key positions have a direct impact on overall organizational welfare.

So, businesses dedicate resources to the selection process of employees to be promoted. The study employs the Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to analyze data. Subsequently, Association rules can be used in Human Resources Analytics to identify patterns and relationships relevant between different factors that contribute to employee promotion or non-promotion, discover co-occurrence patterns, set promotion criteria, employee profiling and career planning, and rule-based decision support. By analyzing historical promotion data and associated employee attributes, association rule mining can provide valuable insights and aid decision-making processes.
